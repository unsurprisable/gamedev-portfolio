# Game Development Portfolio

Hello! This repository is a collection of all the source code for my major game projects so far, regardless of the game engine (so Unity games, for example, only have the Scripts folder included; full project repos will be indicated later on in this README if they exist).

This `README` goes through each of the (3) categories of major projects I've worked on and provides some extra insight on some of those projects (not every file will have a description here).

**"TRAILER" VIDEO COVERING MOST OF THE PROJECTS HERE:** [YouTube: Game Development Portfolio](https://youtu.be/iYOlj7gU6yc?si=q-gNFjxNFcSg2e3B)

## [1] Python Games - (these are probably the most complete ones)

These projects were all developed in my free time while I was taking the AP CSP & AP CSA classes in high school. You can actually play/experience these very easily by going to my [CMU Games Repository](https://github.com/unsurprisable/cmu-cs-academy-games), where they are all available to play in-browser! The repo also includes source code for many of my other smaller games.

### 1. ENGINE (by me).py
> This was the engine I developed for myself which I used in about half of my Python projects. It's heavily influenced by Unity's design patterns but is obviously a lot simpler than Unity. It's also limited by the fact that everything had to be included in a single file due to the library that I was working with (CMU Graphics).

### 2. Balatro Lite
> I think this is the project I'm most proud of to this day. I'm incredibly happy with some of the workarounds I came up with for making a playable Balatro clone in Python while being forced to write everything in only a single file. If you're going to look through any of the source code in this repo, I recommend checking out this one.

### 4. Risk of Raindrop
> This was made for the CMU Fall 2023 Game Jam, and it's basically meant to be a top-down 2D version of Risk Of Rain 2. However, I realized a little too late into development that this concept just wasn't very fun. However, it still works, and has many of the main gameplay features of RoR2 like stages, music, difficulty scaling, and roguelike elements. Unfortunately, I physically could not add every feature I wanted to due to the filesize limit and did not end up placing in the jam :(

### H.M. Doodle Jump Remix
> Unfortunately this one's source code seems to have been lost to time so I don't actually have a way to include it in this repo. However, this is my favorite one gameplay-wise and is playable through the repo linked above!

## [2] Copper Lung (Minecraft)

The full project files can be found at [unsurprisable/copper-lung](https://github.com/unsurprisable/copper-lung) and the [Teaser Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGUCpID1nMI) for the game is on YouTube.

> This game was made for the FlimsyNimsy's Minestom Game Jam, and I ended up WINNING! I spent about two weeks on this project in total. 

> It's basically just a one-to-one port of Iron Lung into Minecraft, including a semi-convincing pseudo-3D renderer for the submarine's camera. If you're curious, you can look at the main camera logic in (SubmarineCamera.java)[2-Iron_Lung_Minecraft_Port/src/main/java/org/example/SubmarineCamera.java].

> I had a lot of fun making this one, and I guess it can be considered my first "fully complete and published" 3D game.

## [3] Unity Projects

Like many other other developers, I have built up a LOT of unfinished/unpresentable projects in Unity. While I have gained a lot of experience through those projects, it does unfortunately mean  I don't have much to show in this category.

### 1. Undercooked
> This is a multiplayer cooking simulator that was mainly developed while following CodeMonkey's incredible [Unity Tutorial Series](https://youtu.be/AmGSEH7QcDg?si=Vf9keyX8Cvv3moHo). All of the art is taken from that free course, however I did take some personal liberties and added my own tweaks as well as a completely custom Roguelike gamemode on my own. Overall, this incredible course has had the most influence on my understanding of standard Unity/C# practices, and has greatly helped me make other games of my own. This one has its own [project repo](https://github.com/unsurprisable/undercooked) as well.

### 2. Untitled Retail Game
> This one has a pretty funny story behind it. But first of all, it is nowhere near finished and there still isn't a gameplay loop even though I've returned to this project like 4 different times by now. The game is basically just meant to be a multiplayer co-op Supermarket simulator where you design and build your own store and then purchase/sell products to your customers.

> The story is that while playing Supermarket Together (the game this was based off of) with a friend, I told him I could easily remake the game on my own in a week. And for some reason, I genuinely believed that. However, considering I started this project over 2 years ago at this point, I think it's pretty clear I was a little off (to be clear, I have NOT been working on it for those two years, I've already decided to abandon it).

> Although this project didn't end up going anywhere, it DID teach me a lot of valuable Data Structures & Algorithms concepts, as well as some advanced Unity concepts like Object Pooling for generating products on dozens of shelves simultaneously. I'd say this project was probably my most valuable resource for learning more advanced abstract programming concepts like Stacks, Queues, Dictionaries, registries, and more, since a lot of the features I implemented were just general, real-world design patterns that happened to be made for a virtual supermarket.

> This one has its own [project repo](https://github.com/unsurprisable/untitled-retail-game) as well.
